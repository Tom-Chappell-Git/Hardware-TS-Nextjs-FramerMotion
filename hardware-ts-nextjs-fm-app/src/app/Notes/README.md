## Core Concept
A website developed for potential PC buyers who desire more details on computer components before making an informed purchase.

**Target Audience**
Although the site attempts to be useful to a wide range of people, the site is designed for those who have specific use cases beyond day-to-day usage; gamers, 3D artists,

## Pages:

## Hardware explaination page:

### CPU Breakdown page
Aim: Give the user a brief explanation of what each CPU component is and what it means to the end user as well as what to take into account when building/bying a computer.

1. Cores
2. Threads
3. Frequency (Base and boost)
4. Cache
5 TDP
6. Architecture (tbd)

### GPU Breakdown page
Aim: Give the user a brief explanation of what each GPU component is and what it means to the end user as well as what to take into account when building/bying a computer.

1. Base clock
2. Boost clock
3. VRAM
4. Power Consumption
5. Architecture (tbd)

### 3D/Blender Benchmarks page
Takes benchmark data from Blender.org to give users benchmark information to inform their purchase decisions. 


## Development Roadmap
The following is a list of features to be added to the project, in order (though the order may change).


1. Add Logo and favicon
2. Link from product card to benchmarks and vise versa.
3. Links to other useful resources; PC building websites and YouTube videos
4. Add "Pros and Cons" for each CPU and GPU (probably on the product card)
5. Fix % calculator for Benchmarks
6. Add % calculator for Gaming
7. Price to performance indicators on Benchmark pages
8. Break pages down into smaller components


## Minor changes to be made

1. Correct RTX 4080 image
